📂 Projects

1. NYC Taxi Analytics (dbt + Postgres)

Tech: dbt, PostgreSQL, GitHub Actions (optional CI), VS Code Power User extension
	•	Problem: NYC taxi data is large and messy (millions of rows, multiple schemas).
	•	Goal: Transform raw taxi trips into clean, analytics-ready marts for insights like revenue, trip volume, and airport traffic.
	•	Highlights:
	•	Staging → Intermediate → Marts modeling with dbt
	•	Incremental model for fct_trip (~3.4M rows handled efficiently)
	•	Source freshness checks & dbt tests (not null, unique, constraints)
	•	Exposures defined for a dashboard dependency graph
	•	DAG lineage visualized via dbt Docs

📂 Folder: dbt-project/nyc_taxi_analytics

2. Databricks Lakehouse Project (coming soon)

Tech: Databricks, Delta Lake, PySpark
	•	Focus on ingesting raw JSON/Parquet data into a bronze-silver-gold pipeline.
	•	Demonstrates Delta Lake merges, deletes, and time travel.
	•	Will include feature engineering with PySpark.

📂 Folder: databricks-lakehouse (planned)

⸻

3. Azure Data Engineering Project (coming soon)

Tech: Azure Data Factory, Synapse, Fabric, Event Hubs
	•	Event-driven ETL pipelines with ADF + Synapse.
	•	Real-time ingestion with Event Hubs → CosmosDB → Synapse Link.
	•	Cost optimization & monitoring with Application Insights.

📂 Folder: azure-etl (planned)

⸻

4. AWS Data Engineering Project (coming soon)

Tech: AWS Glue, Redshift, S3, Lambda, Kinesis
	•	Serverless ETL with Glue + Lambda.
	•	Real-time streaming ingestion with Kinesis → S3 → Redshift.
	•	Data Lakehouse architecture on S3 with partitioning & lifecycle policies.

📂 Folder: aws-etl (planned)

5. Snowflake Data Warehouse Project (coming soon)

Tech: Snowflake, dbt, Airflow
	•	Building a cloud-native data warehouse with Snowflake.
	•	Orchestration and scheduling via Airflow.
	•	Showcases Snowflake features: zero-copy cloning, streams & tasks, and time travel.

📂 Folder: snowflake-dwh (planned)
